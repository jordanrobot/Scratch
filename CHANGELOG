v0.3.58

Changed: renamed some variables and functions to make more sense
Added: cst_getall function - doesn't do much, but is basis for cst_clean
Added: cst_clean function, deletes all objects in layer (not block references though. :< )
Added: fst command, will be for menu, right now points to cst_delete
Added: cst_menu function, right now points to cst_delete

---
v0.3.38

Removed: init_flag variable
Added: a test for constructions layer exists? - replaces init_flag
Bugfix: When crosshair is colored, and reloads lisp file, the reloaded constructions file takes magenta as the old_crosshair_color(s).  The standard crosshair colors are now hardcoded
Bugfix: When reloading lisp file and current layer is constructions - constructions is taken as the original_layer.  Added if tablesearch... in make_cst function to fix.
Bugfix: Quashed stupid extra parenthesis bug that was causing erratic behavior.
Changed: updated TODO
Added: a DOC file, documentation. In progress.

Changed: Logic for creation, switching, and destruction of layer


---
v0.2.32

Changed: TODO file, restructured, added
Added: a function to change the crosshair color.  Right now it only changes to a certain color.
Added: plans for a cst_state flag.


---
v0.2.12

Removed: The old structure, wrappers, the big layer_jump command

Changed: jump_from_layer to original_layer.  That's so much easier to read.

Added: construct (cst) command - This command toggles the active layer between constructions and original_layer.  This is where the original_layer variable is assigned.

Added: destruct (dst) command - This command deletes the constructions layer.  It will change the user back to original_layer before doing so.

Added: internal "jump_in" function - jumps into the "constructions" layer.  For all intents and purposes, jump_in creates the constructions layer each time, so if the layer does not exist, it will be created.

Added: internal "jump_out" function - It jumps back to the layer that was active when the last jump_in was run (original_layer).  If the original_layer variable is not set, it is defaulted to layer 0.
