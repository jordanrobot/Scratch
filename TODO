Todo:

-look at OL behavior when layer 1 is active, a layer 2 object is selected, and then cst is run.  Does this set layer 1 as OL, or layer 2?  Perhaps this would be a desirable thing.  It would make selecting the OL much easier (at the cost of confusing people even more?).

change commands to use ` key?
	I don't think it's assigned to anything by default.  Good use of pinky, rolling towards the spacebar.
	
	construct - `
	destruct - ``e
		note: double `, or a confirmation dialogue to prevent unanticipated deletions?  perhaps a visual indicator of what will be deleted?  or just stick to the the mighty undo?

make crosshair change color when in constructions layer - perhaps a nice magenta

better documentation

copy to constructions command: `c
move to constructions command: `v or `m or ``c

copy from constructions command? (& move from)
	I'm on the fence about this.  would it encourage sloppy use?  Ideally they should just toggle over to OL and create the object there.
		then again, it would increase flexibility.   Probably need more testing time with this before deciding.

isolate constructions command: `s?

toggle constructions layer on/off: `t? `h? `f?

toggle constructions printing property?: low low priority.
