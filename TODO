Bugs:


---
Structure:

-look at OL behavior when layer 1 is active, a layer 2 object is selected, and then cst is run. 
	--ends up running cst in the background
	
-make jump_layer_color user settable?

-change crosshair color back to dynamic, not hardcoded
-make crosshair color a decision tree

---
Commands:

-change commands to use ` key?
	--I don't think it's assigned to anything by default.
	--Good use of pinky, rolling towards the spacebar.
	--construct - c`
	--destruct - e``
		---note: double `, or a confirmation dialogue to prevent unanticipated deletions?  perhaps a visual indicator of what will be deleted?  or just stick to the the mighty undo?

-copy to constructions command: x` or r` or cc`?
-move to constructions command: x` or m`

-copy from constructions command? (& move from)
	--I'm on the fence about this.  would it encourage sloppy use?  
	--Ideally they should just toggle over to OL and create the object there.
	--then again, it would increase flexibility.
	--Probably need more real use testing before deciding.

-isolate constructions command: s`

-toggle constructions layer on/off: t` or h` or f`

-toggle constructions printing property?: low low priority.

-Destroy constructions
	--give a reminder/visual indication of what you're deleting
	--(maybe this stuff isn't such a good idea, prolly just cruft)
